Unitex Library - User's Guide
=============================

`Unitex/GramLab <http://unitexgramlab.org>`_ is an open source, cross-platform,
multilingual, lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite. Unitex tools are designed to perform
several Natural Language Processing (:abbr:`NLP(Natural Language Processing)`)
tasks on a textual corpus relying on linguistic resources such as electronic
dictionaries and grammars represented as finite state transducteurs
(:abbr:`FSTs(Finite State Transducers)`), recursive transition networks
(:abbr:`RTNs(Recursive Transition Networks)`) and lexicon-grammars.

This document is a guide to using the Unitex C/C++ library and and the
Java Native Interface (:abbr:`JNI(Java Native Interface )`), including
methods descriptions and example snippets.

Contributing
============

We welcome everyone to contribute to improve these guidelines. Below are some of
the things that you can do to contribute:

-  Learn a bit about the `RST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__
   (reStructuredText) markup language and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`__
   for creating documentation. A Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet is available
   `here <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`__   
-  `Fork us <https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/unitex-library/fork>`__ and `request
   a pull <https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/unitex-library/pulls>`__ to the
   `develop <https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/unitex-library/tree/develop>`__
   branch.
-  Alternately, if you don't want to learn RST and Sphinx, submit a `bug report
   or a feature request <https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/unitex-library/issues>`__ to
   our GitHub.

Unitex Library - User's Guide
=============================

`Unitex/GramLab <http://unitexgramlab.org>`_ is an open source, cross-platform
and multilingual corpus processing suite. Unitex tools are designed to perform
several natural language processing (:abbr:`NLP(Natural Language Processing)`)
tasks on a textual corpus relying on linguistic resources such as electronic
dictionaries and grammars represented as finite state transducteurs
(:abbr:`FSTs(Finite State Transducers)`), recursive transition networks
(:abbr:`RTNs(Recursive Transition Networks)`) and lexicon-grammars.

This document is a guide to using the Unitex C/C++ library and and the
Java Native Interface (:abbr:`JNI(Java Native Interface )`), including
methods descriptions and example snippets.
